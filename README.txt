Rules :

1. Ship deployment
First player is asked to deploy the ships

The player is in charge of a fleet of 10 ships : 
- 1 Carrier   ----------------- size of 5 blocks
- 2 Battleships   ------------ size of 4 blocks
- 3 Cruisers   --------------- size of 3 blocks
- 4 Destroyers   ------------ size of 2 blocks

*The ships are supposed to be placed on the board either vertically or horizontally.
*Between two ships must be a gap (at least one block).

2. Battle
After deploying all the ship, the gameplay begins.

- Players play in turns, and shoot at coordinates where they think enemy ships are.
- The map is intially filled with dash lines. If a ship is found, it will be marked as X, and a missed shot will become an empty spot.
- If a player has hit a piece of a ship, they can lauch attacks again until miss.
- The one sink all the opponent's ships first is the winner!

Therefore an exe file is prepared and already compiled.
